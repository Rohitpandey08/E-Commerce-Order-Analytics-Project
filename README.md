# 🛒 SQL E-Commerce Order Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a **real-world Data Analyst workflow** in an e-commerce business. Using structured SQL queries, the analysis answers critical business questions around **customer behavior, revenue performance, product trends, and growth patterns**.

## 🎯 Business Objective

An e-commerce company wants to understand:

* Who its most valuable customers are
* Which products and categories drive revenue
* How customer ordering behavior changes over time
* Whether there are inactive or one-time customers

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

The analysis is based on three relational tables:

### 1️⃣ Customers Table

Stores customer-level information.

* `customer_id` (PK)
* `customer_name`
* `signup_date`
* `city`

### 2️⃣ Products Table

Contains product and pricing details.

* `product_id` (PK)
* `product_name`
* `category`
* `price`

### 3️⃣ Orders Table

Captures transactional order data.

* `order_id` (PK)
* `customer_id` (FK)
* `product_id` (FK)
* `order_date`
* `quantity`

## 🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

* `JOIN` (INNER, LEFT)
* `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* Date filtering and time-based analysis
* Window functions (`RANK`, `LAG`, `SUM() OVER`)
* Subqueries and derived tables

## 📊 Key Insights (Example)

* A small group of customers contributes a disproportionately high share of total revenue
* Electronics category generates the highest revenue despite fewer products
* All customers in the dataset have placed at least one order, indicating strong initial activation
* Repeat customers show increasing order values over time
